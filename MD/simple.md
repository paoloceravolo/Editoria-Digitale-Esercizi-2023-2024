# Intro
Go ahead, play around with the editor! Be sure to check out **bold** and *italic* styling, or even [links](https://google.com). You can type the Markdown syntax, use the toolbar, or use shortcuts like `cmd-b` or `ctrl-b`.
As mentioned in [@lorena2019complex]

## Lists
Unordered lists can be started using the toolbar or by typing `* `, `- `, or `+ `. Ordered lists can be started by typing `1. `.

#### Unordered
* Lists are a piece of cake
* They even auto continue as you type
* A double enter will end them
* Tabs and shift-tabs work too

#### Ordered
1. Numbered lists...
2. ...work too!
